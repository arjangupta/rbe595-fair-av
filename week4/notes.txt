# Lecture 3 - robotics in mobility
- global package delivery volume and cost graphs
- amazon shipping costs graph
- rest of the lecture is about analyzing automation in first mile, middle mile, and last mile delivery

# Lecture 4 - robotics basics
- There are 6 main technologies in robotics
  - systems development
  - human robot interaction
  - mechatronics
  - perception
  - navigation
  - cognition
- robotic system ability slide shown
    - decisional autonomy is the one we're interested in
- decisional autonomy: basics for wheeled robots
    - sensors -> perception
    - goal selection -> slam
    - path planning -> motion control -> wheel commands
